# NLA Method Pipeline

Reproduction of [Natural Language Autoencoders](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2026/nla/) (Anthropic, 2026)
using **Qwen2.5-0.5B** in place of the paper's Qwen2.5-7B. Reference code: [kitft/natural_language_autoencoders](https://github.com/kitft/natural_language_autoencoders).

---

## Overview

The NLA consists of two jointly-trained models:

- **Activation Verbalizer (AV)**: takes a residual-stream activation h_l and generates a natural-language description z
- **Activation Reconstructor (AR)**: takes a description z and predicts the original activation h_l

Training is bootstrapped through two supervised warm-starts (one per model) before joint RL with GRPO. This document details the full pipeline as implemented, filling in steps the paper leaves implicit.

## Stage 0 — Activation Extraction

**Script:** `scripts/generate_data.py` · **Runner:** `scripts/run_generate_data.sh`

**What it does:**  
Streams the FineWeb sample-10BT corpus and runs Qwen2.5-0.5B in forward-only mode. A hook on layer 16 captures the residual-stream vector h_l at sampled positions within each document.

**Key decisions vs paper:**

| Aspect | Paper | This repo |
|---|---|---|
| Corpus | FineWeb sample-10BT | FineWeb sample-10BT ✓ |
| Target model | Qwen2.5-7B | Qwen2.5-0.5B (GPU budget) |
| Probe layer | ~20 (7B model) | 16 (0.5B model, ≈ 2/3 depth) |
| Positions/doc | 10 | 10 ✓ |
| Dataset scale | ~1M vectors | 100K (validate first) |
| Min context | not stated | 150 tokens (~500 chars) |
| Activation dtype | float32 | float32 ✓ |

**Output format:**  
HuggingFace Dataset saved to `activations/dataset/`:
- `text_truncated` — the text the model saw up to the extraction point  
- `activation` — float32 array of shape (896,) — the raw residual stream at h_l

**Activation statistics (100K run):**  
Norms roughly N(μ, σ) with no extreme outliers; no normalisation applied before storing.

---

## Stage 1 — LLM Explanation Generation

**Script:** `scripts/generate_summaries.py` · **Runner:** `scripts/run_generate_summaries.sh`

**What it does:**  
For each `text_truncated`, calls DeepSeek V4-Flash to generate a structured linguistic analysis of what the language model is "thinking about" at the truncation point. The analysis targets the information content of h_l — what patterns and constraints the model has built up — rather than summarising the text's topic.

**Prompt (2–3 feature version, from reference codebase `stage2_api_explain.py`):**  
Asks for the 2–3 most important features the language model would use to predict the next token, ordered by importance. The final feature must analyse the last token specifically. Format: `<analysis>…</analysis>` with ~80–100 words total.

> **Prompt version note:** The paper appendix specifies a 4–5 feature / 150–200 word prompt. The reference codebase uses the shorter 2–3 feature version. We use the reference version, as it matches the published experiments and is faster to generate.

**Response cleaning (mirrors reference `_extract_and_clean`):**
1. Extract content inside `<analysis>…</analysis>` — tags are **not** stored
2. Strip list-prefix markers (`-`, `*`, `•`, `1.`, etc.)
3. Strip `**bold**` markers
4. Strip stray `*` and `_` from line edges
5. Drop empty lines; rejoin with `\n\n`
6. Reject if fewer than 2 non-empty lines remain → retry (up to 4 attempts)

**Why cleaning matters:** DeepSeek (like Claude) naturally formats responses with bold headings and bullet points. Storing cleaned plain text means the AR prompt during training is consistent with what it will receive from the AV during RL — the AV should not need to learn to produce markdown formatting.

**Filtering and scale:**
- 16,929 samples (< 400 chars) skipped — too short for meaningful analysis
- 83,071 samples processed
- Throughput: ~87 it/s at concurrency=1000
- Runtime: ~16 minutes for 83K samples
- Checkpoint: `activations/summaries_checkpoint.json` — safe to interrupt and resume

**API provider note:**  
Paper uses Claude Opus 4.5. We use DeepSeek V4-Flash (~$4/100K vs ~$75 for Claude Opus). The reference codebase uses Claude Haiku (similar cost tier). Quality difference is unknown; structured prompting is followed well by DeepSeek.

## Stage 2 — AR Warm-Start

**Script:** `scripts/train_ar_baseline.py` · **Runner:** `scripts/run_ar_pretraining.sh`

**What it does:**  
Trains the Activation Reconstructor (AR) to map text descriptions → activations, using the LLM-generated `summary` column as a supervised signal. This establishes that the AR can decode text into h_l before RL begins. The FVE achieved here is the warm-start quality that the joint GRPO phase will try to maintain or improve.

**AR architecture:**
- Base: Qwen2.5-0.5B transformer body, truncated to layers 0..16
- Final norm replaced with `nn.Identity()` so `last_hidden_state` = raw residual stream (matching what the hook captured during Stage 0)
- Head: `nn.Linear(896, 896, bias=False)`, initialised as identity matrix
- Total trainable parameters: 390M (full model unfrozen)

**Why truncate the base?**  
A single linear head cannot invert the remaining 7 transformer layers (17–23) plus the final norm. Truncating to the extraction depth makes the model's own residual stream at layer 16 the output, which exactly matches what we're trying to reconstruct.

**Why identity init?**  
At initialisation, AR(z) = base(z)[:, -1, :] — i.e. the model just reads out its own last-token representation. This gives starting loss ~1.61 vs ~1.94 for random init, and avoids the head fighting against the base in early training.

**Input format:**  
`AR_PREFIX + summary + AR_SUFFIX` = `"Summary of the following text: <text>{summary}</text> <summary>"`  
The last-token hidden state at the position of the final `>` token is fed to the linear head.

**Data split:**  
Uses only the first 50K rows (rows 0..49999). The second 50K rows are reserved for AV SFT so the two warm-starts see disjoint examples — matching the reference 50/50 split (`av_sft_frac: 0.25 / ar_sft_frac: 0.25` in their config).

**Activation normalisation (`mse_scale`):**  
Before computing the MSE loss, each activation target is normalised to L2 norm = √d_model = √896 ≈ 29.93. This matches the reference `mse_scale = sqrt_d_model` config. The motivation is to keep regression targets at a stable scale regardless of raw activation magnitude, and to match the injection scale used by the AV (see Stage 3).

**Training configuration:**

| Hyperparameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Head LR | 1e-4 |
| Base LR | 1e-5 (= head LR / 10) |
| Schedule | Cosine annealing → 0 over 15 epochs |
| Gradient clipping | 1.0 |
| Batch size | 32 |
| Epochs | 15 |
| Data rows | 0..49 999 (50K) |
| val split | 10% |
| Loss | MSE on mse_scale-normalised targets |

**Result:** val FVE ≈ 0.47 (paper reports 0.3–0.4 as warm-start target). Converges by ~epoch 10; 15 epochs sufficient.

**Diagnostic note on FVE:**  
FVE = 1 − E[‖h_l − â‖²] / E[‖h_l − h̄_l‖²] = R² from statistics. FVE = 0 means no better than predicting the corpus mean; FVE = 1 is perfect reconstruction. Scale-invariant when both predictions and targets are normalised consistently.

**Issues encountered:**
- Early runs used plain text summaries → FVE ≈ 0.0007
- LR of 2e-5 was too conservative → raised to 1e-4
- Missing gradient clipping → added `clip_grad_norm_(..., 1.0)`
- Initially used all 100K rows; split to 50K after discovering reference uses a 50/50 disjoint split between AR and AV warm-starts

## Stage 3 — AV Warm-Start

**Script:** `scripts/train_warmstart.py` · **Runner:** `scripts/run_av_warmstart.sh`

**What it does:**  
SFT the Activation Verbalizer to generate, given h_l, the LLM-produced linguistic explanation for that activation. Using `summary` (not `text_truncated`) ensures AV and AR share the same description language: AR was trained to reconstruct h_l from summaries, so AV must learn to produce summaries in the same style.

**AV architecture:**
- Base: full Qwen2.5-0.5B (all 24 layers + LM head), fully trainable
- No truncation — AV is a standard text generator, not a vector encoder

**Soft token injection (reference: `design.md` + `injection.py`):**  
The prompt contains the rare Unicode character `㊗` as a placeholder. At forward time, the standard embedding lookup result at that position is overwritten with the normalised activation:

```
h_l_injected = h_l × (injection_scale / ‖h_l‖₂)
injection_scale = √d_model = √896 ≈ 29.93
```

This scales h_l to the ambient residual-stream magnitude — the 75th-percentile activation norm measured over our dataset is 28.61, confirming `√d_model` is an accurate proxy (within 4.4%).

**Prompt format (reference: `stage3_build.py` `_DEFAULT_ACTOR_TEMPLATE`):**  
Single user message, no system message, wrapped via `tok.apply_chat_template`:

```
You are a meticulous AI researcher conducting an important investigation into
activation vectors from a language model. Your overall task is to describe the
semantic content of that activation vector.

We will pass the vector enclosed in <concept> tags into your context. You must
then produce an explanation for the vector, enclosed within <explanation> tags.
The explanation consists of 2-3 text snippets describing that vector.

Here is the vector:

<concept>㊗</concept>

Please provide an explanation.
```

**Target response (reference: `wrap_explanation()` in `schema.py`):**
```
<explanation>
{summary}
</explanation>
```
Cross-entropy loss is computed on the response tokens only; the prompt is masked with `-100`.

**Data split:**  
Uses rows 50000..99999 (second 50K) — disjoint from AR's first 50K.

**End-to-end FVE evaluation:**  
After each epoch, the frozen AR checkpoint is used to compute a joint quality signal:
1. AV generates descriptions for 100 val samples (greedy decode, max 120 new tokens)
2. Content inside `<explanation>` tags is extracted from each output
3. AR reconstructs â from each description using the standard AR prompt
4. FVE(â, h_l) is logged alongside val_loss

This is the true metric of interest — it measures whether AV is producing descriptions the AR can decode, not just whether the cross-entropy loss is falling.

**Training configuration:**

| Hyperparameter | Value |
|---|---|
| LR | 5e-5 |
| Schedule | Cosine annealing → 0 over 10 epochs |
| Gradient clipping | 1.0 |
| Batch size | 8 |
| Max sequence length | 512 tokens |
| Data rows | 50 000..99 999 (50K) |
| val split | 10% |
| Loss | Cross-entropy on response tokens |

**Issues encountered:**
- First run used `text_truncated` as target → severe overfitting (val_loss climbed while train_loss fell). Root cause: raw texts are long and highly varied; model memorised training texts rather than learning to condition on the activation signal
- Second run used wrong prompt format (`"Explain: <concept>㊗</concept>"`) → inconsistent with reference and shorter than the actual system prompt the model should learn to respond to
- Fixed both: target changed to `summary`, prompt updated to full paper system prompt via chat template

## Stage 4 — Joint GRPO Training

**Script:** `scripts/train_grpo.py` · **Runner:** `scripts/run_grpo.sh`

**Status:** ✅ Complete — best e2e FVE **0.594** at step 1000 (500-sample fixed eval)

**What it does:**  
Jointly trains AV and AR using Group Relative Policy Optimisation. For each activation h_l:
1. AV samples K=8 candidate descriptions from N=16 activations per step
2. AR reconstructs â_k = AR(z_k) for each
3. Reward: r_k = −MSE(norm(â_k), norm(h_l)); FAILED_REWARD = −2.0 for missing `<explanation>` tags
4. Group-relative advantage: A_k = (r_k − mean(r)) / std(r) within each group of K
5. AV updated via policy gradient + KL penalty against frozen SFT reference
6. AR updated via supervised MSE on all valid descriptions

GRPO avoids a learned value function by using the within-group reward mean as a baseline.

**Hyperparameters (matching reference `rl.sh`):**

| Hyperparameter | Value | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| N (prompts/step) | 16 | 128 on 8 GPUs |
| K (samples/prompt) | 8 | 8 |
| AV lr | 1.41e-5 (constant) | rl.sh lines 102, 126 |
| AR lr | 1.41e-5 (constant) | rl.sh lines 102, 126 |
| KL coefficient β | 0.01 | rl.sh line 54 |
| max_new_tokens | 150 | rl.sh line 108 |
| Rollout batch | 4 activations | (our addition for ~3× speedup) |

**Training results:**

| Step | e2e FVE (training log, 200 samples) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | — (not logged pre-fix) | warmstart baseline |
| 1000 | 0.5746 | peak in training run |
| 5000 | 0.5725 | plateau; marginal change from step 1000 |

Best checkpoint (500-sample fixed eval): **grpo_av/ar_step1000.pt → FVE 0.594**

Reference (7B model, 4199 steps): FVE 0.752

**Why FVE plateaus at step 1000:** The 0.5B model is near its capacity ceiling — the 896-dim residual stream at layer 16 encodes less recoverable semantic information than the 3584-dim stream at layer ~20 of 7B. Description quality (2–3 features vs paper's 4–5) is a secondary limiting factor. The gap is structural, not a training failure.

**Resume from checkpoint:** `train_grpo.py` accepts `--av-checkpoint`, `--ar-checkpoint`, `--ref-checkpoint`, and `--checkpoint-base` flags to start from any saved AV/AR pair. The KL reference should be set to the same checkpoint being resumed from (not the original SFT), so KL measures drift from the current position rather than pulling back to the original policy.
